Hi, I'm Umberto Junior Mele, a Ph.D. candidate at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence ([IDSIA](https://www.idsia.ch/idsia_en/institute/people/phd-students.html)) in Switzerland. 
I'm currently working to enhance Machine Learning applications to Combinatorial Optimization problems.
Such problems have a broad spectrum of applications spanning various scientific and manufacturing domains. 
One of these applications, which is relevant to me, is using Artificial Intelligence to reduce energy consumption and improve the environmental impact.

My academic journey led me to a master’s degree in [Data Science](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it/node/5559/data-science-graduate-students) from the Sapienza University in Rome. Building on that foundation, I had the privilege of serving as a teaching assistant for five years for the master's course in Artificial Intelligence at the [Università della Svizzera italiana](https://search.usi.ch/en/people/0a1accbbbe28abee72cb11cb882012da/mele-umberto-junior). This experience enriched my understanding of AI and allowed me to contribute to shaping the next generation of AI enthusiasts.

Lugano, Switzerland, is where I call home these days. The city, with its charming aura, is nestled amidst nature's lap, offering a sense of serenity and refreshment. For those with an affinity for nature, Lugano is a must-visit. Every weekend presents an opportunity to discover a new peak or enjoy a peaceful lakeside view.
